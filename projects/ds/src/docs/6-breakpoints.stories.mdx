# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are CSS lengths intended for use in media queries. In Styled System the breakpoints scale is used to create mobile-first responsive media queries based on array values.

For example, using a margin value of `[ 2, 3, 4 ]` creates styles with multiple mobile-first min-width media queries.

```js
 {
   margin: '8px',
   '@media screen and (min-width: 40em)': {
     margin: '16px',
   },
   '@media screen and (min-width: 56em)': {
     margin: '32px',
   },
 }
```
